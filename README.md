# MIPS-assembler
This is a MIPS assembler I wrote for school. It is arguably the largest piece of software that I have written and I am very proud of it. It takes in a .asm file and returns the corresponding binary file for the MIPS architecture. See the pdf document for guidance on how the lines in the asm file are translated to binary.
